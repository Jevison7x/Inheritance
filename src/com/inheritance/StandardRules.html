                a. Male & female are of the same class<br>
                b. This rule applies during the distribution of residual shares, and not the distribution of prescribed shares<br>
                c. This rule doesn’t apply to maternal siblings. They are either ways given from prescribed shares

                a. In case of Awal, and in the presence of Grandfather, sisters will be removed from the 2/3rd zone. Grandfather & sisters then will divide in the ratio of 2:1. (Disturbing Case).

                <b>19) In Radd case,</b>when the total is less than 1, all shares, except the shares of the spouse, should be increased proportionately so that the total share is 1. The spouse shares are strictly fixed. They cannot be increased unless no far relatives are found.

                b. Parents will share the remainder with the 2:1 ratio for father & mother<br>

                a. Full brothers should share equally with the maternal siblings. Effectively, full brothers are treated as maternal siblings.<br>

                f. If the fractions sum exceeds 1, Awal should be applied; Grandfather’s share is not Ta’seeb in this case.<br>
                g. During this calculation, Full Sister & paternal sister ‘s share should be excluded (if they are in 2/3rd zone)
